# Data Analysis of AQI from 1980 to 2022

## Overview

This project delves into the intricate world of air quality by conducting a thorough analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) data spanning from 1980 to 2022. The primary objective is to unravel patterns, trends, and underlying factors that contribute to air pollution over this extensive time frame.

## Key Highlights

- **Temporal Trends:** Uncover the evolution of AQI over four decades, identifying key periods of improvement or deterioration.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Analyze how air quality varies with the changing seasons, pinpointing any recurring patterns.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Explore regional differences in air quality, understanding how diverse locations contribute to the overall AQI.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate the relationships between AQI and various contributing factors, such as industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and meteorological conditions.

## Data Sources and Cleaning

The dataset utilized for this analysis aggregates historical AQI data from diverse sources, offering a comprehensive perspective on air quality. Rigorous cleaning and preprocessing ensure data reliability and consistency, forming the foundation for meaningful insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive and reproducible analyses.
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Getting Started

Explore the `notebooks/` directory to find Jupyter Notebooks detailing each aspect of the analysis. Clone the repository and follow the steps in the README to set up the environment and replicate the analysis on your machine.

## Results and Conclusions

Discover key findings, visualizations, and insights derived from the analysis. Gain a deeper understanding of the complex landscape of air quality, and consider how the results can contribute to broader discussions on environmental policies and public health.

## Future Directions

This project is a stepping stone for future enhancements. Future work may involve additional analyses, integration with real-time data sources, or the development of predictive models to forecast AQI trends.

## Acknowledgments

This project stands on the shoulders of various data sources, tools, and libraries. Acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of those who made this analysis possible.
